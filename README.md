 Designing an Evaluation Framework for Legal Question-Answering

In my study, i use three Large Language Models:
    - Gemma
    - Mixtral
    - Llama

Gemma and Llama are used to evaluate legal answers in the original dataset language (in French) and additionally in the (automatically) translated dataset (using mixtral to translate) in English.

Three evaluation frameworks are implemented: 
 - Boolean
 - 3 point Likert framework
 - 5 point Likert framework
