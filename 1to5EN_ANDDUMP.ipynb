Under no circumstances is alimony granted to the spouse found guilty of a fact provided for in articles 375, 398 to 400, 402, 403 or 405 of the Penal Code, committed against the person of the defendant, or of an attempt to commit a fact provided for in articles 375, 393, 394 or 397 of the same Code against this same person. Derogating from article 4 of the preliminary title of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the judge may, while waiting for the decision on the public action to become final, grant the plaintiff provisional alimony, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. He may make the grant of this provisional alimony subject to the establishment of a guarantee that he determines and the terms of which he fixes.\n",
            "§ 3. The court sets the amount of alimony which must cover at least the state of need of the beneficiary. It takes into account the revenues and possibilities of the spouses and the significant deterioration of the economic situation of the beneficiary. In order to assess this deterioration, the judge relies in particular on the duration of the marriage, the age of the parties, their behavior during the marriage with regard to the organization of their needs, the charge of the children during the common life or after it. The judge may decide, if necessary, that the pension will be decreasing and determine to what extent it will be. Alimony cannot exceed one third of the income of the debtor spouse.\n",
            "§ 4. The duration of the alimony cannot exceed that of the marriage. In the event of exceptional circumstances, if the beneficiary proves that at the expiration of the period provided for in paragraph 1, he or she remains, for reasons independent of his or her will, in a state of need, the court may extend the period. In this case, the amount of the pension corresponds to the amount necessary to cover the state of need of the beneficiary.\n",
            "§ 5. If the defendant proves that the need of the plaintiff results from a unilateral decision taken by the latter, and without the needs of the family justifying this choice, he or she may be exempted from paying the pension or only required to pay a reduced pension.\n",
            "§ 6. The court that grants the pension states that it is adapted de jure to the fluctuations of the consumer price index. The base amount of the pension corresponds to the consumer price index of the month in which the judgment or the judgment granting the divorce becomes final, unless the court decides otherwise. Every twelve months, the amount of the pension is adjusted according to the increase or decrease of the consumer price index of the corresponding month. These modifications are applied to the pension from the due date following the publication in the Belgian Monitor of the new index to be taken into account. The court may, in certain cases, apply another system for adjusting the pension to the cost of living.\n",
            "§ 7. Unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise, the court may, at the request of one of the parties, increase, reduce or suppress the pension, if, following new circumstances and independent of the will of the parties, its amount is no longer adapted. Similarly, if, following the dissolution of the marriage, the liquidation-partition of the common patrimony or of the co-ownership that existed between the spouses entails a modification of their financial situation which justifies an adaptation of the alimony having given rise to a judgment or a convention intervened before the establishment of the accounts of the liquidation, the court may adapt the pension, 2.\n",
            "§ 8. The alimony can at any time be replaced, with the agreement of the parties, by a capital approved by the court. At the request of the pension debtor, the court may also grant capitalization at any time.\n",
            "§ 9. The spouses cannot renounce their rights to alimony before the dissolution of the marriage. However, they may agree, during the procedure, on the amount of this pension.\n",
            "§ 10. The pension is no longer due upon the death of the debtor, but the beneficiary may claim maintenance from the estate under the conditions provided for in article 205bis, § 1er and §§ 3 to 6. The pension definitively ends in any case in the event of remarriage of the beneficiary of the pension or at the moment when this last makes a declaration of legal cohabitation, except by agreement of the parties. The judge may terminate the pension when the beneficiary lives maritally with another person.\n",
            "§ 11. The court may decide that in case of default by the debtor in the performance of his or her payment obligation, the beneficiary of the pension will be authorized to collect the revenues of the latter or those of the goods that he or she administers under their matrimonial regime, as well as all other sums that are due to him or her by third parties. This decision is enforceable against any third-party debtor, present or future, upon notification made to them by the clerk at the request of the plaintiff.\n",

In the absence of a worker referred to in subsection 1, the same right applies to the worker who, at the time of the birth: 1° legally cohabits with the person with respect to whom filiation is established and where the child has their main residence, and they are not united by a prohibited kinship which they cannot be dispensed from by the King; 3° has cohabited permanently and affectively with the person with respect to whom filiation is established and where the child has their main residence, for an uninterrupted period of three years preceding the birth, and they are not united by a prohibited kinship which they cannot be dispensed from by the King. Proof of cohabitation and main residence is provided by means of an extract from the population register. The condition of 2° and 3° relating to the main residence of the child is not applicable when the child is stillborn. Only one worker is entitled to birth leave under the preceding subsection, in respect of the birth of the same child. Workers who open entitlement to birth leave under 2° and 3° respectively have successive priority over each other. The right to maternity leave under Article 39 of the Act of 16 March 1971 on work excludes, for the same parent, the right to birth leave opened by the preceding subsections. Birth leave opened under subsection 3 is, where applicable, deducted from adoption leave under Article 30ter. It does not also, where applicable, open up other civil, social and economic rights. The King fixes, by deliberate Royal Order in Council, the arrangements for granting birth leave, where the conditions under subsection 3 are met. During the first three days of absence, the worker benefits from maintenance of their remuneration. During the twelve days following and during the additional days referred to in subsection 2, the worker benefits from an allowance the amount of which is determined by the King and which is paid to them within the framework of health care and disability insurance.\n",

The onus of proof of these reasons rests with the employer. At the worker's request, the employer shall make the employer aware of them in writing. If the reason given in support of the termination of the contract of employment does not meet the requirements of subsection 1 or in the absence of a reason, the employer shall pay the worker a lump-sum indemnity equal to the gross remuneration for six months, without prejudice to any other indemnities due to the worker in the event of termination of the contract of employment. This indemnity may not, however, be combined with other indemnities provided for in the context of a specific procedure for protecting the worker against dismissal. For the purposes of this subsection, termination of the contract of employment by the employer during the protection period, as referred to in subsection 1, is deemed to include any act of the employer following that period which seeks unilaterally to terminate the contract of employment of the worker and for which preparatory measures were taken during that period.

At the worker's request, the employer shall provide written details of the reasons for the non-renewal. The employer must prove that the non-renewal of the contract of employment in question is unrelated to the birth of the child. If the reason given in support of the non-renewal of the contract of employment in question is not unrelated to the birth of the child, or in the absence of a reason, the employer shall pay the worker a lump-sum indemnity equal to the gross remuneration for three months.

In the absence of an agreement regarding the organization of the child's housing, important decisions concerning the child's health, education, training, leisure activities, and religious or philosophical orientation, or if such an agreement appears to be contrary to the child's best interest, the competent family court may grant exclusive parental authority to either the father or the mother. The court may also set the educational decisions that can only be made with the consent of both parents. The court determines the terms under which the parent without parental authority maintains personal relationships with the child. These relationships cannot be refused except for serious reasons. The parent without parental authority retains the right to monitor the child's education.

In the absence of an agreement regarding the organization of the child's housing, important decisions concerning the child's health, education, training, leisure activities, and religious or philosophical orientation, or if such an agreement appears to be contrary to the child's best interest, the competent family court may grant exclusive parental authority to either the father or the mother. The court may also determine the educational decisions that can only be made with the consent of both parents. The court sets the terms under which the parent without parental authority maintains personal relationships with the child. These relationships cannot be refused except for serious reasons. The parent without parental authority retains the right to monitor the child's education.

In the event of exceptional circumstances, if the beneficiary proves that at the expiration of the period provided for in the first paragraph, he or she remains, for reasons beyond his or her control, in a state of need, the court may extend the period.

Every twelve months, the amount of the pension is adjusted according to the increase or decrease of the consumer price index of the corresponding month. These modifications are applied to the pension from the due date following the publication in the Belgian Monitor of the new index to be taken into account. The court may, in certain cases, apply another system for adapting the pension to the cost of living.\n",

Similarly, if the dissolution of the marriage, the liquidation-partition of the common property or the co-ownership existing between the spouses results in a modification of their financial situation which justifies an adaptation of the alimony which has been the subject of a judgment or a convention intervened before the establishment of the accounts of the liquidation, the court may adapt the pension, 2.\n",

            "Article 1: Without prejudice to article 50, the parties may agree to a revision of the rent between the ninth and the sixth month preceding the expiration of each three-year period. In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the judge may order a revision of the rent if it is established that due to new circumstances, the normal value of the leased property is at least twenty percent higher or lower than the due rent at the time of filing the application. The judge may also grant an increase in rent to the landlord who establishes that the normal value of the leased property has increased by at least ten percent of the due rent at the time of filing the application, due to works carried out at their expense in the leased property, with the exception of works necessary to bring the leased property into compliance with the conditions of article 9, paragraph 1. If this revision results in an increase in the rent, it is only due if the lease was concluded in writing and, for a lease of an immovable property, if the written lease has been registered. The judge rules in fairness. The action may only be brought between the sixth and the third month preceding the expiration of the current three-year period. The revised rent takes effect from the first day of the following three-year period, with the provisional continued payment of the old rent until the final decision. However, in the case of article 55, paragraph 8, the parties may waive the right to request a revision of the rent.\n",

Notwithstanding any clause or agreement to the contrary, the judge reduces the rent to the due rent in accordance with the previous lease, adjusted proportionately to the cost of living, if the landlord does not prove that the rent was fixed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1. The adjusted rent is calculated as follows: base rent at the beginning of the nine-year period, multiplied by the index of the month preceding the month of the conclusion of the new lease and divided by the index of the month preceding the month of the conclusion of the lease at the beginning of the nine-year period.\n",

When the father and mother do not live together, the joint exercise of parental authority remains in effect, and the presumption provided for in Article 373, paragraph 2, applies. In the absence of an agreement regarding the organization of the child's housing, important decisions concerning the child's health, education, training, leisure activities, and religious or philosophical orientation, or if such an agreement appears to be contrary to the child's best interest, the competent family court may grant exclusive parental authority to either the father or the mother. The court may also specify the educational decisions that can only be made with the consent of both parents. The court determines the terms under which the parent not exercising parental authority maintains personal relationships with the child. Such relationships cannot be refused except for serious reasons. The parental authority holder retains the right to monitor the child's education, obtain useful information from the other parent or third parties, and approach the family court in the child's interest.

However, if the court deems equal housing not to be the most appropriate solution, it may decide on a non-equal division of housing. When parents have multiple children, the court aims to adopt the same regime for all siblings. If necessary, the court specifies how siblings maintain personal relationships with each other.
